# TrustFlow: Reputation-Based Decentralized Lending Protocol

TrustFlow is an innovative decentralized lending protocol built on the Stacks blockchain that introduces a reputation-based lending system, enabling unsecured loans based on borrowers' on-chain activity and behavior.

## Overview

TrustFlow revolutionizes DeFi lending by moving away from traditional over-collateralization models, instead utilizing a comprehensive reputation system that considers various aspects of users' on-chain behavior to determine creditworthiness.

### Key Features

- **Reputation-Based Lending**: Loans are issued based on reputation scores rather than collateral
- **Dynamic Scoring System**: Reputation scores factor in loan repayment history, governance participation, and staking behavior
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven governance system for reputation appeals and protocol updates
- **Micro-Loans**: Facilitates small to medium-sized loans without collateral requirements
- **Incentive Alignment**: Rewards positive behavior and penalizes defaults through reputation adjustments

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

1. **Reputation System**
   - Score Range: 0-1000
   - Initial Score: 500
   - Multiple scoring factors:
     - Loan repayment history
     - Governance participation
     - Staking behavior

2. **Lending Mechanism**
   - Maximum loan amount: 1,000,000 microSTX
   - Loan duration: ~10 days (1440 blocks)
   - Minimum reputation requirement: 500
   - Single active loan limit per user

3. **DAO Governance**
   - Proposal creation and voting system
   - Reputation score appeals
   - Minimum voting threshold: 10 votes
   - Voting power tied to reputation scores
   - Required reputation for participation: 700

### Security Features

- Comprehensive input validation
- Safe arithmetic operations
- Access control mechanisms
- State transition validations
- Proper error handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- STX testnet/mainnet tokens for deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trustflow.git
cd trustflow
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Deployment

1. Configure your deployment settings in `settings.json`:
```json
{
    "network": "testnet/mainnet",
    "privateKey": "your-private-key"
}
```

2. Deploy the contract:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Usage

### Initializing Reputation

```clarity
(contract-call? .trustflow initialize-reputation tx-sender)
```

### Requesting a Loan

```clarity
(contract-call? .trustflow request-loan u100000)
```

### Repaying a Loan

```clarity
(contract-call? .trustflow repay-loan)
```

### Creating an Appeal

```clarity
(contract-call? .trustflow create-appeal-proposal 
    target-user 
    requested-score 
    "Appeal reason")
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Security

- All input parameters are validated
- Integer overflow protection
- Access control checks
- State transition verification
- Regular security audits recommended

### Known Limitations

- Maximum loan amount fixed at contract deployment
- Single active loan per address
- Fixed loan duration
- No partial loan repayments

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Loan Terms**
   - Variable loan durations
   - Flexible repayment schedules
   - Interest rate based on reputation score

2. **Enhanced Reputation System**
   - Additional reputation factors
   - Cross-chain reputation integration
   - Reputation delegation

3. **Governance Extensions**
   - Parameter adjustment voting
   - Protocol upgrade mechanisms
   - Emergency pause functionality
